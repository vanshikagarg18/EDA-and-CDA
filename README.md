# EDA-and-CDA
The two important data analysis methods EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) and CDA (Confirmatory Data Analysis).

### EDA
EDA or Exploratory Data Analysis is one of the data analysis methods where we use different statistical summaries and graphical representations to perform initial investigations on the data to discover interesting patterns, spot anomalies, and overall for a better understanding of our data.

### CDA
Confirmatory Data Analysis is the process of using statistical summary and graphical representations to evaluate the validity of an assumption about the data at hand.

## Project Overview
The dataset has 5 types of information :-
1. Time Information (Order Data)
2. Customer Information (Customer Name)
3. Place Information (State name)
4. Hierarchical Information about the products (Category, Sub-category, Product Name)
5. Sale Information (sales, profit, quantity)

In EDA, Data Exploration on all these 5 information has beem done to retrieve insights from the data using various types of plots such as line chart, bar chart, choropelth chart, pie chart, histogram, box plots.
In CDA, various assumptions has been made and validate using visualization.
